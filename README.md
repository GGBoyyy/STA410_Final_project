# Bayesian Imputation for Missing Financial Data

This project demonstrates a Bayesian approach to imputing missing values in financial time series data using **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**. The methodology is implemented in a clean Python module and demonstrated through Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“ˆ What It Does
- Simulates or loads financial time series data
- Introduces missing values
- Uses Bayesian Gaussian Process regression to impute missing values
- Visualizes both predictions and uncertainty intervals

## ðŸ§  Why Gaussian Processes?
- Flexibly model smooth time series patterns
- Quantify **uncertainty** in imputed values
- Fully Bayesian, interpretable and principled

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
### 1. Clone and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finance_missing_imputation.git
cd finance_missing_imputation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the demo notebook
Open `notebooks/demo_imputation.ipynb` to:
- See how missing values are introduced
- Watch the imputer in action
- Visualize uncertainty bounds

### 3. Explore the methodology
Open `notebooks/methodology_explained.ipynb` to understand the math and rationale behind the approach.

## ðŸ“š Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

(Install using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or manually.)

## âœ¨ Future Extensions
- Multivariate GP imputation
- Real-world financial datasets (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
- Kernel tuning and model selection
