    "# Bayesian Imputation for Missing Financial Data using Gaussian Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    " In financial modeling, time series often have missing values due to reporting issues, \n",
    " data collection problems, or market closures. Accurately imputing these missing values \n",
    "#is crucial for downstream analysis, such as forecasting, risk modeling, or portfolio optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian methods offer a principled way to impute missing values while quantifying uncertainty. \n",
    "Here, we use **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**, a flexible non-parametric Bayesian approach, for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Gaussian Processes?\n",
    "A Gaussian Process (GP) defines a distribution over functions. It's particularly suitable for time series data because:\n",
    " - It captures smooth trends and periodicity.\n",
    " - It provides uncertainty estimates for predictions.\n",
    " - It can handle arbitrary missing patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    " Given data:\n",
    "   - x = [x1, x2, ..., xn]  (time steps)\n",
    "   - y = [y1, y2, ..., yn]  (observed values, some missing)\n",
    "\n",
    " We model y ~ GP(m(x), k(x, x')) where:\n",
    "   - m(x) = 0 (mean function)\n",
    "   - k(x, x') = C * exp(- (x - x')^2 / (2 * l^2))  (RBF kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    " Using the GP posterior, we compute the predictive distribution at missing locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Highlights\n",
    " We implemented a `BayesianGPImputer` class that:\n",
    " 1. Identifies non-missing values to train the GP.\n",
    " 2. Uses the posterior to impute all points (including observed, for validation).\n",
    " 3. Returns mean and standard deviation for each point.\n",
    "\n",
    " This is enabled using `sklearn`'s GaussianProcessRegressor and a flexible kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    " - Captures complex temporal patterns (trends, cycles).\n",
    " - Estimates **uncertainty**, not just point estimates.\n",
    " - Fully probabilistic, consistent with Bayesian principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    " - Computationally expensive for large datasets (O(n^3)).\n",
    " - Requires choosing/validating kernel hyperparameters.\n",
    " - May underperform if time series is non-stationary and poorly modeled by kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extensions\n",
    " - Use Sparse GPs for scalability.\n",
    " - Combine with domain-specific priors (e.g., financial volatility).\n",
    " - Apply to multivariate time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    " Bayesian Gaussian Process imputation offers a powerful, interpretable method to handle \n",
    " missing financial time series data. This approach enables us not only to recover missing \n",
    " values, but also to **understand the confidence** we have in these estimatesâ€”\n",
    " key for decision-making in finance."
